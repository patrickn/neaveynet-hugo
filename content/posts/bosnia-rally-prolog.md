description: The rally doesn't start for a couple of days but the prolog is an optional extra stage over a short 60km trail around Kupres. Most of the competitors haven't arrived yet so it's a good chance to test out your kit and bike setup.

Arriving early not only gets you a great parking spot at the rally but you also get the chance to join in the additional 60km prolog stage. This was an optional stage and useful as a shakedown before the real rally begins in a couple of days. Although most of the riders haven't shown up yet, there are still quite a few here to do the prolog.

As part of the prolog day, in the morning, there is an introduction talk on the use of the roadbook. This is basically an informal walk through of the roadbook we will be using for the prolog and an explanation of the layout and symbols used and doesn't take long.

After stopping for lunch it is time to start the prolog, the weather is ideal, dry, but not to warm.

I haven't ridden my 701 seriously for some time so I take it easy to begin with. But soon build up the confidence to ride a little harder. The trails are gravel and a few small rocks, nothing to challenging. I take the chance to get used to using the roadbook. In Greece I had a lot of problems with the roadbook as the accuracy was not the best (to put it mildly) but so far this one was spot on. I was finding my ICO a very few metres, if any, out at the junctions.

It had been raining the last few days so there were some muddy sections. In paticular a single track through a forested section caused quite the traffic jam. There was no room to pass so the only thing to do was to wait inline, or walk to the front to help the other riders through the muddiest bits.

A GS rider made a small mistake and dropped his bike in what was basically a big puddle, or small pond. It was about 3 metres across and about 1/2 metre deep and very muddy with steep banks on either side. I powered through and managed to get out the other side but was covered in mud. The water reached over both wheels and when I emerged from the opposite bank, steam was billowing from the exhaust and engine.

One more river crossing and we were back at the hotel. Roadbook was spot on, bike behaved flawlessly and it was a great trail. Tomorrow was registration and scrutineering for the real start the day after.
