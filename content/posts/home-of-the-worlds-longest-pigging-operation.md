Today's Fact of the Day. As today is a rest day I haven't been doing much but I did have a walk around and discovered a signpost pointing to the East Riding village of Easington. No, I'd never heard of it before either. But in 2009 a letter was sent from here 750 miles under the sea to Easington via 'pig'.

It was so exciting it even made the [Hull Daily Mail](http://m.hulldailymail.co.uk/Pig-delivers-letter-Scandinavia/story-11978831-detail/story.html).
