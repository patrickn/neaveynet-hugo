description: Packing up and getting ready to leave was again done in the rain, and I left the campsite in wet weather gear.

There was a short section of autoroute as we skirted Rijeka but once past we turned of the autoroute onto the E65. The weather had been improving gradually and by the first coffee stop it was like a different world. The rain clouds were gone and the sky was more blue than cloud. 

After the coffee stop was the first and longest of the 2 off-road sections. There were some sharp bends and tricky rocky sections mixed in with patches of sand and gravel. It wasn’t too technical but was a bit tricky in parts. There were also a few very fast straight sections where you could really fly if you had the skill and confidence to do so. 

We reached a height of about 1200m and although the temperature dropped, because I was having to work hard on the off-road bits, didn’t feel cold. For the fist time this week I arrived at the campsite dry and in sunshine, it was a new experience.
