description: Yesterday when we arrived the weather was great, I even managed to dry some gear out. Later that evening though, it started raining and it didn’t stop all night.

The next morning the rain was alternating between heavy and torrential. I packed up my tent in the wet, again, and put on my rain gear. I left quite late, just after 09:00 and decided to stick to the paved alternative route. 

It was still an interesting ride, through small towns and villages but I was getting wetter and colder and not having a good time. After about 80km the route started to ascend to about 1000m out of one valley into a neighbouring one. At this point the rain really started to fall, I can’t remember the last time I have seen rain that heavy, let alone ridden in it. 

I rode down into the valley and then up again into yet another. This time something was different, the rain had stopped, the road looked almost dry and the temperature started to rise from 10°C, to 11 to 12. Then I could see actual blue sky. The road straightened out a bit and I accelerated towards the clear sky. The temperature was still rising and reached 23°C for the last km’s before the campsite.
