I set off about 08:30, and was almost straight on the autobahn. The first couple of hours was just autobahn, heading south, passing Munich in the east. The weather started out ok, but it wasn’t long before it started drizzling. 

It wasn’t long after and I crossed the border into Austria. Despite the rain and the cold I was heading for the 45km Grossglockner High Alpine Route. In between showers the road did dry out occasionally and it was a very nice fast road. But as soon as I dried out slightly it was time for another shower. 

There is a toll to use the Grossglockner, €30 for a motorbike but I had a code from the organisation so I didn’t have to pay anything. Starting at about 500m the top of the pass is about 2500m and to reach that are a series of hairpins and switchbacks. I’m sure it would be great on a good day, but at about 1000m I rode into a cloud and visibility dropped to nothing. So it was like that all the way up to the top. The temperature dropped too, as I ascended. Eventually, having reached the top it was about 7°C and there was still snow lying about along the side of the road. 

The view wasn’t that impressive either.

Having reached the cafe at the top, there was only one way to go. That was down, and it wasn’t long before the weather improved, the roads were dry and the temperature started rising, reaching 23°C. I was finally able to see something other than cloud.
