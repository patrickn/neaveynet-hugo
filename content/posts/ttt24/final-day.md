description: Today it was like another world. I actually woke up to blue skies and sunshine. It was the final day and I had decided this was to be an early start.

Breakfast was not until 07:00, but I was up at 06:00 to get ready and pack up my tent etc. I eventually left the campsite about 08:00 on todays 247km route. 

We rode around Lake Peruca to the opposite side and the road ascended with some really nice hairpins up the side of the valley. The roads are mostly really good condition, the traffic is light and it is only at the higher altitudes were the ground freezes do you see much damage.

I noticed some other Ténérés at a small cafe so decided to stop for a mid mornong coffee.

Continuing in the trail it wasn’t long before I left the road and hit the first of the off-road sections, a tight gravel single track that continued ascending. The track wasn’t to difficult, there were some tight bends and the gravel was not too deep but on a particular rocky section I made the rookie mistake of being sat when I should of been standing, the front tyre hit a big rock ander was unable to react in time and the bike lurched to the left and went down. 

Both me and the bike were fine, the worse thing was that I managed to roll into a bush and spent the next 15m picking splinters out of my gloves.

It wasn’t that much later when I stopped for a break I saw a wild boar and several small piglets, they crossed the trail slightly ahead of me. Of course I didn’t have the camera ready.

I joined the asphalt again to pass through Knin, lots of cafes and bars lined the streets and each seemed to have several Ténérés parked outside. Well there were 150 of us.

After Knin I was soon back on the gravel again, passing through forests and some tight bends. Everything was pretty dry now but here were still some big puddles to avoid. I usually try to miss them as they can be very deep, but sometimes it’s just not possible so you end up getting g covered in muddy water. 

This final day had the most off-road sections of all days and although it was not that technical there were some tricky parts, rocky ascents and descents, muddy corners and some really fast long straights. The scenery added to the whole experience, being up high I could see for miles. 

I was heading down now on the final trail, it wasn’t long before I hit asphalt for the last ride into Ténéré Town. I had left early this morning so I could take it really easy and just have fun. The trails today were fantastic and made up for the wet week it was almost 18:00h when I crossed the finish line and collected my finishers medal.
