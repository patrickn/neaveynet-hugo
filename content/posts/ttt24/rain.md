description: Arriving at the campsite in Austria, the weather wasn’t too bad. But it wasn’t long before the rain arrived, and it was a lot of rain.

There was thunder and lightning too, I was half expecting to wake up in the middle of a lake. The next morning, although still raining it wasn’t as bad as I thought. Some weren’t so lucky though, and a large room was made available for sleeping if things got too bad.

The rain continued for most of the day as I left Austria into Slovenia. The temperature dropped to about 7°C and things weren’t looking good. 

In Slovenia we reached the first off-road section, a gravel track with some tight bends and moderate inclines. The surface wasn’t that wet but feeling cold and wet myself I was not in the best frame of mind to go too fast.

Later on that day as I was low on fuel and not far from the end of the trail, the day brightened up. The rain stopped and there were even patches of blue in the sky. The last 30-40km were off-road and I was finally getting in to it. Even though it was great to finally arrive at the bivouac and not in the rain.
