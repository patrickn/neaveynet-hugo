We had rain in the night, but by morning the weather was looking a lot better. But even so the motocross track was closed until midday while it dried out a bit. However, there were still other, smaller, tracks that were open. Each was designed to test a particular aspect, riding around obstacles, slow speed manoeuvres etc. We had all day to try the various tracks so it was fairly relaxed. 

There were a couple of additional challenges for today, each challenge earns points and the highest at the end of the week wins a trophy. The first was to take a picture of Pappenheim Castle, with your rider number somewhere in the frame. I couldn’t get very close to the castle so had to settle for a distant view from the road side.

The second challenge was to take part in the slow race. But, it was made harder because half way along the 20m course you needed to pick up a tennis ball from off the top of a bollard in your right (throttle) hand and place it back on another bollard at the end of the run. After a couple of failed attempts I did manage to complete the task, but nowhere as slow as the eventual winner. 

The highlight of the day was a display by Pol Tarrés, who made a 180kg bike do some crazy things, jumping up vertical walls and over 1.5m concrete pipes. I also got him to autograph my bike.
