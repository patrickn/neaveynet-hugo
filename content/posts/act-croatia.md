ACT [Adventure Country Tracks](https://adventurecountrytracks.com/finisher-sticker/) is an organisation setup to discover and preserve off-road trails throughout Europe. There are currently 7 tracks, each lasting 5 days and typically aimed at the bigger adventure bikes (the GS crowd).

A new track is presented in a YouTube video about once a year. The track for Croatia can be seen below.

I don’t intend to do the whole of ACT Croatia but I did get the chance to do the trail from day 2. I was riding towards the north, opposite to the intended direction. A lot of the trail from day 2 was familiar as a lot was the same tracks used for the Ténéré Travel Trophy, albeit in reverse. There were some sections I recognised from a few days ago, but some were new. The weather was a lot better this time around in any case.

Although meant for big bikes there are some tricky sections, so not to be recommended for the complete novice. Apart from a long asphalt stretch at the end (or the start if doing it the right way around) the trail was probably 80% gravel. The route ascended to about 1200m at the top via some tight bends where the temperature dropped to a more comfortable 22-23°C. At the lowest points in the trail it was more like 30°C.

The trail alternated between hard packed gravel and the deeper bigger gravel stones that can be tricky to ride fast. There was even a section through a forest with a few dried up puddles. The scenery and views are, as expected, amazing. A lot of the trail runs parallel with the coast and boats can be seen island hopping way off in the distance.

I was taking it easy as I was alone and carrying luggage and the whole trail took about 6 hours. It is an excellent trail and if you get the chance to ride ACT Croatia, or any of the ACT trails, just do it.
