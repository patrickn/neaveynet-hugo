Something happens to drivers when they cross the border into Romania. It's like they can no longer bear to be behind another vehicle. And it's not just the local Romanians, other nationalities exhibit the same. If there is a vehicle in front and the slightest chance they can overtake, then they go for it. Whole streams of cars will attempt to overtake a slow lorry if the opportunity arises and I've seen a car overtaking a van towing a trailer overtaking another van (I hope I have that on video).
