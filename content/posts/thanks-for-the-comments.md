Thanks for all the comments guys, at least someone is reading this waffle. I am currently 100km west of Helsinki and looking for a BMW dealer to service my bike. If I can get that done in Helsinki I will spend a couple of nights here before getting the ferry to Estonia.

I know I have a couple of posts to catch up on, from Alta to here but just wanted again to say thanks for watching. ðŸ˜ƒ
