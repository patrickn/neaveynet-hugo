It was a pretty uneventful journey to Bosnia. I packed the car Wednesday morning and left shortly after lunch just following the satnav. I left Belgium and drove through Germany almost reaching Austria, but stopped just before the border somewhere. It was too late to book a room anywhere so I just slept in the car. It actually worked out quite well, it was fairly comfortable with the seat fully reclined so I had a decent sleep.

I was awake at first light and after washing in the services I left about 05:30. The thinking was that it would be cooler and there would be less traffics about. Things were going great until lunch time when, in Austria, I hit a big traffic jam. At times we were completely stationary, and several drivers and bored kids were getting out of their cars to walk around. After covering over 700km on the first day, I barely reached half that on the second.

Another night in the car and only about 400km left. It was Friday now and the traffic was much better as I crossed Slovenia, Croatia and reached the Bosnian border. Here there was a small queue, but it wasnâ€™t a long wait to get through passport control. The border officers did seem to take a special interest in the fact that I had a trailer, though. They didnâ€™t want to see the car papers, just the trailer certification. Everything seemed to be in order and I was soon through at out of the EU.

There were a couple of autoroutes but most of the Bosnian roads were small, curvy B roads up and down mountains. With very little traffic it was smooth going and I finally reached the Adria Ski hotel about 15:00.
