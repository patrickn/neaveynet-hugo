description: Day 2 of my ACT Croatia journey and I got to ride ACT Croatia day 1!

The ACT Croatia route is meant to be ridden over 5 days in a north to south direction. I am travelling north, so I started somewhere in the middle and ride the routes backwards. I done day 2 yesterday and today will ride day 1, Puma to Optija. 

I booked 2 nights near the finish so I could leave my luggage in the room and take minimal gear. I took the autoroute direct to the start in Pula, a ridding about 1 hour 40 minutes. 

The starting point for ACT Croatia is in a national park, Cape Kamenjak, a 6km long and 1km wide peninsula. There are many beaches and trails to explore here but unfortunately I don’t have the time as it is 217km back to Opatija and it’s already 11:00.

Leaving the Safari bar at the start of the ACT Croatia route does take you through some of the park. But before long you exit and are straight into the Pula traffic. This route is a lot more asphalt than day 2, which I rode yesterday. I hit the traffic at the worse possible time too. I did stop briefly to take a picture of the Amphitheatre, built around the same time as the coliseum in Rome it is now used for film festivals, sports events, concerts and many other events.

Shortly after leaving the city I hit the first trail, not as difficult as yesterday but similar make-up. The scenery is very different here, this is wine country and the trail leads past many vineyards. There are no small villages or cafes here, just large expensive looking villas complete with swimming pool. The area also seems to be a centre for truffle hunting, I see several signs advertising truffles for sale.

The trails may have been easier than yesterday but they were also a lot faster. A tightly packed gravel surface and some long straights made for a quick progress. I just wish I could take the corners a bit faster, as that’s were I lose a lot of speed.

The off-road trails were interspersed with lots of asphalt, but even that was a great ride. Plenty of hairpins and fast switchbacks to keep the ride exciting. I left Pula this morning at about 11:30 and arrived in Opatiji at almost 19:00, having stopped along the way for lunch and photo breaks. It was a long way but a fabulous route.
