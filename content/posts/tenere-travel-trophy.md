description: What better way to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Yamaha Ténéré than to send 100 riders of all abilities on a mixed on and off road 1500km adventure from France over the Pyrenees to Andorra and finally Spain.

The Travel Trophy was starting today in Dreux, about 70km west of Paris. One novel feature was that you could pay a bit extra and have your bike and luggage shipped to the starting point. So I was on a coach with about 40 other Ténéré owners circumnavigating the Paris Périphérique.

We arrived in the first Ténéré Town about 15:00, right on time, to find all our bikes unloaded and waiting. After setting up my tent there was plenty of time to grab a beer before dinner and the evening’s entertainment.

We were going to be two nights in Dreux, and the next day we had the chance to try out the 33 hectare off-road playground. This was graded in 7 levels and started with a grassy inclined field with several tight corners up to a short but fun motocross track. The in between levels were a mixture of fast whoops, jumps and narrow single track, in increasing difficulty. Although I have all levels a go, it was levels 4-5 that I found the most fun. There were some fast bits and some jumps that felt like I was 2m in the air, but that in reality were probably 2cm. In the afternoon there was a short outride around the local area. 

Stage 1 the next day was the real start of the journey. After packing up my tent and depositing it and the rest of my luggage in the transport truck I could leave for stage 1. As we were still in the north of France todays route consisted of a lot of asphalt. But the organisers had done an excelllent job of finding all the best motorcycling roads in the area. 

To earn points along the way we are set various simple challenges and todays was to buy a postcard somewhere along the route, write a personal message on it to friend or family, then hand it in for posting to the organisation at the end of the day. As I hadn’t seen anywhere that looked likely to sell postcards, I was getting near the end and dashing in and out of shopping malls and newsagents until I was eventually successful. As I was just a few kilometres short of the end I was caught in a torrential shower, the streets turned into rivers and after waiting out under a tree for the worst of it, I put on my waterproofs and made a dash the the bivouac at a go kart track in the Auvergne. 

Stage 2 was through the Massif Central and one of the largest groups of extinct volcanoes anywhere in the world. It was a great mixture of paved and unpaved roads through small medieval villages with ancient churches and castles. Again the weather was great until the last few kilometres when it started raining again. So for the second time I was to arrive at the bivouac eet and put my tent up in the rain.

Stage 3 was along granite plateaus in wide open spaces. We followed the Gorge du Tarn and the Tarn river as it headed south. View of the day was from a 800m plateau looking down on the [Millau bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millau_Viaduct?wprov=sfti1). Again the organisation had managed to find a great mix of some of the best motorcycle roads in the area with a really nice mix of paved and unpaved. 

Stage 4 was through some very rough roads and challenging terrain. We headed down through [Galamus gorge](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorges_de_Galamus?wprov=sfti1) under overhanging rocks and through tunnels and started to head up into the Pyrenees. There were lots of sharp hairpin bends on paved and on the unpaved gravel roads. We crossed the border into Andorra and there would be no camping tonight as we were sleeping in comfort in a really nice hotel. 

Stage 5 was the final day and it was to be the most off-road intensive. We left the hotel and headed straight into the Pyrenees along old smuggling routes. We navigated mountain slopes, Catalan villages past waterfalls and wild horses. There were a couple of river crossings to add to the fun and there was always a small group congregating on the opposite side to witness the next rider through. 

Then all of a sudden we had reached the end, passing under the finishing arch at the final Ténéré town we received a finishers medal and had a photograph taken. It was a great ending to a great week, there were prizes for those that had gotten the most points for the weeks challenges and a real sense of achievement for everyone.
