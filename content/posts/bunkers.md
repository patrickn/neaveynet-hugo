Albania is covered in these bunkers, about 170,000 of them. Built during the [Enver Hoxha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enver_Hoxha) governnment from the 1960's to the 1980's. Most were abandoned in the early 90's following the collapse of the communist government but some have been reused for all sorts of purposes, such as cafes and [museums](/albania).
