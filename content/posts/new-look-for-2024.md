I have been thinking of doing this for sometime, there are many sites that sell vinyl wraps not only for the T7. I finally found on that I liked and fit with the red on the seat and the gold wheels. It's not that different from the OEM look, but hopefully will stand out from the crowd more.

This is only the second time I have tried applying decals to a bike. I wrapped my 701 after the rally rebuild. I warched a few iinstructional videos and, as always, they make it look far easier than it is.

If you have a large flat surface to apply to then it can be straightforward, but when you get angles, corners and bits of bodywork to fit around it is not quite so easy. A good heat gun helps, but then you have to be careful not to use too much heat.

Still, I think it looks good from a short distance, and onve it gets dirty you won't notice my mistakes.
