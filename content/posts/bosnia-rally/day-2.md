According to my time card I arrived back yesterday at 17:50, but some people were still out on the trail much later than that. So for the remaining days a time limit was imposed. Everyone was to be back at the bivouac by 18:00. This was so that in case of any problems, the rescue werenâ€™t expected to be out late into the evening.

Once again the weather was ideal, and even as we rode up into the mountains the temperature was great. Trails were typically rocky with some More technical than others. I was getting into the flow now, and even managed to pass some riders. There were a lot of narrow single tracks with very limited passing opportunities so on occasion we were riding single file.

One particularly loose, downhill trail gave me my first off. The backend just lost traction and swung around to try and overtake the front. The bike laid down with me on top of it, making quite a loud scraping noise. I was surprised to see no damage either to myself or the bike. Apart from some scratches and a bent handguard.
