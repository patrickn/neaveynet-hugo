Yesterday was registration day and the day most of the riders start arriving. The morning was fairly quiet so registration was very quick, just sign your name and pick up your welcome pack and GPS tracker. There was also a ‘technical inspection’, which seemed to just consist of applying a sticker to my bike.

I also picked up five days of road books. So the next couple of hours were spent with a big beer on a big table marking up them up.

The morning of day one was quite chaotic. It seemed everyone wanted to get away early. So I waited for the queue to calm a bit before joining. It was about 09:30 before I got away. There was a short asphalt section before we were straight on the trails.

The only drama was on a narrow rocky stage up a fairly steep incline. I came around a corner to see a bike in the ditch to my left. The rider must have overshot the corner and gone straight of the track. He was fine, but it took three of us and a rope to haul his bike out of the ditch and book onto the trail.

The weather was great, and the route headed up into the wildernes. There were patches of mud and some very rocky sections but it was fast going. I passed a few breakdowns, mostly punctures, and stopped to take in the view a couple of times. Despite there being many more riders it was nowhere near as bunched up as the prolog.
