description: Lots of mountains, lots of really nice trails and lots of mud, I had some clutch problems on day 3, so decided to take a rest day. I also wanted to do some general maintenance to the bike, but, apart from the clutch everything was running great so far.

Day 4 was a 290km loop south towards Konjic. It wasn't long before all sign of life disappearred and the trails became remote single track. The conditions where ideal and the trails seeed to go on for ever. There were wild ponies scattered in some of the more remote areas and the occasional farm house.
