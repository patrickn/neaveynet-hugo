Day 5 was the final day and consisted of a loop around Livno in the south west of about 189km. Everything started out great, bike was running fine with no issues apart from still having problems with the clutch. But it was working and I was able to ride as normal.

We headed up the ski slopes again to the wide plateaus where the trees became less common and the views opened up so you could see for miles. There were some really deep and rocky gravel trails which caught a few people off guard and I passed a number of casualtys stopped by the side of the trail. I always slow down and wait for either a thumbs up or OK signal before carrying on.

More herds of wild ponies could be seen, this time I stopped and was able to take a photo of them.

Sometime in the afternoon when I wasn't all that far from the end I stopped to have a quick break and drink of water. We were passing through a small town and I just pulled over in a small parking area next to a closed cafe or restaurant.

When I went to start the bike, nothing happened! The fuel pump didn't spin up and the starter didn't engage. This was an intermittant problem that I had seen before, but the first time on this rally. I know from diagnosing this before that it is an issue with the throttle position actuator, but I have never figured out the actual problem as it occurs so infrequently. I left the bike off for a few more minutes before trying again and it fired up as if nothing had been wrong.

I didn't want to risk being stranded in the middle of nowhere and I was quite near the end so i decided to bail and head straight back to the bivouac.
