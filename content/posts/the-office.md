This has been my office for the week. At the top left you can see the GPS transmitter that sends my current location to the rally organisers. This allows them to see my location at all times and to know if I am on track or heading the wrong way. Top right is my ICO showing kilometres ridden, it is used together with the roadbook (centre).

The roadbook is a very long roll of paper showing the distance to the next turn as well as any obstacles or dangers along the route, it's quite straightforward once you get used to it but does take a lot of concentration to use correclty when travelling at speed. As you can see, I am at kilometre 192.85 (100's are not shown on the ICO) about to bend to the left through a village.

At the bottom are the normal dashboard indicators for oil, speedo etc. Plus I have a switch to select front/rear fuel tanks, cooling fan on and to turn ABS off.
