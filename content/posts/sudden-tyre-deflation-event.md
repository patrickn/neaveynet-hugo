Or puncture if you like. I was getting an amber warning when leaving Lunde about rear tyre pressure. So at the next garage I checked the tyre and couldn't see anything obvious. I topped up the air and carried, keeping an eye on the pressure. About 180 miles later whilst waiting for the Aukra ferry I glanced down at the tyre and noticed the head of a nail sticking out. How I missed it earlier I don't know.

As I had just booked 2 nights in Aukra I left it until the next day to repair. I pulled out a 4" nail when I did get round to fixing it. I've plugged it but it's still losing air slowly and requires topping up every 100km or so. I'm going to have to find a more permanent solution as soon as I can.
