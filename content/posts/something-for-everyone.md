description: When we left the hotel at Dades we weren’t really expecting anything much. But the ride turned out to be one of the best and most varied of the trip.

It started out with a ride through Dades Gorge, then we started to climb and the road became tight switchbacks with amazing views. After several kilometres of this we reached the end of the asphalt and the road became a mountain single track, winding around the peaks with nothing but wilderness all around.

We really did feel in the middle of nowhere. After some time on the single track we came over a rise and round a corner to find brand new asphalt. The road was now ascending the other side of the mountain and was fast and twisty.

After several more kilometres we started to come across small villages. The Moroccans don’t bother laying asphalt through the villages so it was back to sand and loose gravel.

Today was a great day and there really was something for everyone. There was hardly any traffic, once we got away from Dades, and the variety in scenery and road was amazing.
