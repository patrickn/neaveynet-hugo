The ferry crossing to Nador was about six hours. We didn't pay the extra for a cabin so all we could do was find somewhere to sit. After getting something to eat we moved to a lounge area. There was a TV in the corner showing what looked like the weekly lottery number selection. The number selection was punctuated with two kids chanting some sort of prayer in Arabic, in very annoying high pitched voices. This seemed to go on for a couple of hours, and we were both chanting along by the end.

It was already getting late when we arrived in Nador and after queuing to get through border control it was even later. Our passports had already been checked on the ferry, now we needed to show the bike documentation so that we could get a tiny slip of paper as confirmation. Then after a quick search of our luggage we were finally allowed to leave the port. 

It was quite dark now but we knew where we were going as we had booked a hotel earlier in the day.
