I spent Wednesday waiting for Daniels concert in the evening. So took the chance to video a little ride around Budapest. Crossed the Danube a couple of times between Buda and Pest. Everywhere is one-way so even if you know where you want to be, it may not be straightforward to get there. Lots of cars and trams make it interesting to drive also.
