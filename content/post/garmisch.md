After riding through Munich I arrived in Garmisch. It was mid-afternoon and just as I arrived, it started raining. It continued to rain, monsoon more like, while I put up my tent. Then it stopped and the sun came out, which was nice.

After finding a little bar for dinner it started raining again, this time it didn't stop. The rain last so long I was forced to stay in the bar and watch the football show. Portugal versus Poland, if your interested. It was Portugals turn to win.
