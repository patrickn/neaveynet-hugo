There are a lot of hazards on the roads, deer, X5 drivers but I didn't expect that. Didn't see anything when I got there. 


So, I'm riding towards Munich and it's really hot, like 37.5°. In the distance I thought I saw lightning, and before long, sure enough, the clouds started to get darker and darker. Then someone flicked a switch and the temperature dropped to 20°. The ground was really wet, but it looked like I had missed what was a pretty big downpour. Few more kilometres and the temperature was back up to 30°. You couldn't make this stuff up. :-)
