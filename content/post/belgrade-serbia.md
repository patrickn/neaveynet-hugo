I left Baja early (ish) morning and headed south to meet Marko in Belgrade. According to the map it was only a three hour ride, but it was getting hotter and hotter which always slows things down a bit. Passing through the border was really easy, present passport, passport stamped, passport returned and away.

Apart from the border station there is nothing to indicate any change, the landscape is the same, flat and the roads are still straight and long. Still staying off the highways I pass alternating fields of wheat, sunflowers and maize with the occasional roadside water melon stand thrown in for variety.

I arrived at Marko's flat at about 18:00, after taking a few wrong turnings through Belgrade. After a quick shower and a quick hello to the family it was time for a beer. We met up with a few people at a local micro brewery named Kompas Pivo (Compass Beer) where we talked and drank until midnight. 

On Thursday I was invited to a cycle ride around Lake Ada in the centre of Belgrade by Marko's uncle Miki and his daughter Angela. We cycled the 8km around the lake and then walked under the Ada Bridge which crosses the Sava river. 

We had a quick planning meeting on the Friday evening where it was decided to leave Sunday morning and head south! So with planning over we drank more beer.

Saturday nights entertainment was provided by a local biker club. They were staging a rock concert so we rode a few kilometres outside Belgrade to a field on the banks of the river Sava. It was a typical headbangers event, a lot of the men had longer and better conditioned hair than the women and the music was loud. On arrival we could see lightning in the distance and the evening was interrupted a couple of times by heavy showers.
