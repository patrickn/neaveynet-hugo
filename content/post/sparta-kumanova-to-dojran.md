After a quick breakfast of some Macedonia pastry 'thing' we left Kumanova mid morning. We were on the highway heading south and it was getting really hot, up to 39Â°C at one point. We had a relatively short ride though as we were heading for lake Dojran just inside the border.

On arriving at Dojran it was clear that this was a popular holiday location. There were bars and cafes all along the lakes edge and lots of people strolling about going nowhere in particular. We rode past all that to a small shaded wooded area, there were already a couple of tents pitched under the trees so we joined them. Although not really a designated camp site no one seemed to mind so we pitched our tents ready for the night.
