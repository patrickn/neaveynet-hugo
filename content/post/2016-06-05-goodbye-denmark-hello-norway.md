It may have been a shed with a bunk bed but that was the best nights sleep for a long time. Or maybe it was the Danish beer last night, or the eat as much as you want salad with home made chips, or the warm ice cream for dessert. Anyway, ferry is not until 12:45 so no hurry.&nbsp;

Last night, being Friday, was late night opening in Hj√∏rring. So all the shops stay open until 10:00pm and there are pavement stalls and music and all sorts. Lots of people about, eating, drinking and &nbsp;shopping.
