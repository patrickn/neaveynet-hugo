Something happens to drivers when they cross the border into Romania. It&rsquo;s like they can no longer bear to be behind another vehicle. And it&rsquo;s not just the local Romanians, other nationalities exhibit the same. If there is a vehicle in front and the slightest chance they can overtake, then they go for it. Whole streams of cars will attempt to overtake a slow lorry if the opportunity arises and I&rsquo;ve seen a car overtaking a van towing a trailer overtaking another van (I hope I have that on video).
