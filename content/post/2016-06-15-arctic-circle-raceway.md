Just north of Mo i Rana and 30km south of the Arctic Circle is the [Arctic Circle Raceway][1]&nbsp;the&nbsp;biggest race track in Norway.&nbsp;

I can&#8217;t see anybody about as I ride right up to the pit lane and was able to have a good luck around the pits. Apart from the main circuit there is a motocross and go-kart track, neither of which were in operation at the time.&nbsp;

Across the other side of the circuit I could see a car and signs of life so I went across. There were a couple of guys putting up signs or fences so I chatted with them a bit about the site.&nbsp;

&#8220;Would be OK to have a ride round the circuit?&#8221;, I asked.&nbsp;

&#8220;Sure, we don&#8217;t see anything.&#8221;, one of the guys said.

So I did, I rode back to the pit lane and out onto the track. I was taking it easy to start as I didn&#8217;t know the track and didn&#8217;t want to go too mad. It was difficult to hold back on the straights though, however the straights are quite short and it&#8217;s not long before you hit another bend.&nbsp;

On the second lap I was a bit faster. If I could have stayed longer I am sure my lap times would have improved. ðŸ˜Š
