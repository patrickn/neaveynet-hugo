Daniel is on a school trip in a couple of weeks to Hungary. As part of the school orchestra he will be performing 3 concerts in Budapest.

So, always looking for an excuse for a tour, I will be riding to Budapest to meet up with him and watch one of the concerts. I leave a couple of days before him, he is flying, and intend to stop off at friends on the way. It will take me about 3 days to get to Budapest and I will post pictures here of my journey to Budapest and beyond.

Apart from booking the ferry for Friday 10 July and meeting friends in Belgium that evening, nothing else is planned. So let's see what happens. &#x1f600;
