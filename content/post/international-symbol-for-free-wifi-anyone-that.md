Anyone that has travelled any distance will know that one of the most vital and fundamental requirements when on the road is internet access. With roaming charges what they are, we need to be able to get online regularly and often. Frequent travellers will know to look out for the International free WiFi symbol, the upside down ‘W’ can be seen from some distance away along main roads and in cities. What’s more, you can often get coffee and something to eat at the same place.
