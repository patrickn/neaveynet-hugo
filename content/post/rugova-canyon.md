I eventually had to admit defeat and gave up looking for my keys, I guess it really is 'BMW Keyless Ride' now. I was heading towards Peć in the very west of Kosovo near the border with Montenegro. The weather had cleared and the journey was pretty uneventful. The scenery is not overly exciting but the roads are quiet and well maintained. Arriving in Peć things change very quickly though.

The whole place seems to be in a state of chaos, I don't know whether this is tourist season or it's always like this but there are cars and people everywhere.
