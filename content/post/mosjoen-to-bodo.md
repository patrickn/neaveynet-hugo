The hotel in Mosjøen was cheap and tidy. The landscape on the way here has changed quite a bit. I am no longer riding through mountains, but now in the valleys between them. The mountains are way in the distance on either side.

Weather is getting a lot cooler though still dry. I arrived at the Bodø ferry terminal at about 19:00. There are two German bikes already here and a couple of camper vans. Both waiting for the next ferry to Moskenes on the Lofoton Isles. Checking the timetable, the next ferry is not until 00:45 though, so we have a long wait.

I had a quick ride around Bodø to find a cafe and petrol and to pump up my tyre. It&#8217;s quite a large town, there&#8217;s a lot of people around going to bars and restaurants. By this time it was gone 21:00 and still daylight so ingot the impression that things were only just getting started.&nbsp;

Returning to the ferry terminal there was nothing much to do except try and get some sleep in the waiting room.
