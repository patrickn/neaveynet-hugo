Albania is covered in these bunkers, about 170,000 of them. Built during the communist era, you can read all about them on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunkers_in_Albania?wprov=sfti1]). On my last trip to Albania, although looking for them I never saw any. This time I have seen three in a couple of days.
