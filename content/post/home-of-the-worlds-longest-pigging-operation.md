Today&#8217;s Fact of the Day. As today is a rest day I haven&#8217;t been doing much but I did have a walk around and discovered a signpost pointing to the East Riding village of Easington. No, I&#8217;d never heard of it before either. But in 2009 a letter was sent from here 750 miles under the sea to Easington via &#8216;pig&#8217;.&nbsp;

It was so exciting it even made the&nbsp;[Hull Daily Mail][1].
