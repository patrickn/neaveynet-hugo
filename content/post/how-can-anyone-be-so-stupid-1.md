The next morning the rain clouds still looked threatening and the forecast didn't offer any positive encouragement to hit the road, so I decided to stay an extra day in Laplje Selo. It was a nice enough if very small village and it had a pizzeria. I walked the length of the main street which seemed to be where all the 'action' was, and that over I went to the cafe for a coffee.

One of the favourite features of my bike is the keyless ignition. It means I never have to fumble around in my pocket to find the ignition key, I just walk up to the bike, and as long as the key is in range, press a button and I'm ready to go. The key is always kept in the same pocket and I never take it out. It's worked great for the last two years and 25000 miles, but...

My ignition key stays in my pocket all the time, but on the same keyring are my two luggage keys so I need to take the key out to unlock or lock my luggage to the bike. That's OK, use the keys then put them straight away. What you shouldn't do is balance all the keys on the rear of the bike on top of a tail bag.
