I covered 428.3 miles today, it was in the low 30s for most of it as well so I was ready for shower when I got to the hotel. Leaving Hungary was ok, the autoroutes are very good so you can sit at the limit (130km/h) mile after mile with only the occasional car to get in the way.

Crossing into Romania, I stopped at the border to show my passport (first time since leaving the UK) then proceeded to buy a vignette to use the toll roads. I was surprised to find out that motorcycles are exempt from tolls, which was nice.

Turns out though, that half the autoroutes havenâ€™t been built yet! You can be cruising along one minute, next the road is blocked off and you are diverted onto the old secondary routes. And some sections of autoroutes that have been built are a mystery to the sat nav, obviously recently opened.

Anyway, I made it about 20:00, just in time for dinner and beer. Iâ€™m in a hotel right at the north end of the TransfÄƒgÄƒrÄƒÈ™an. Canâ€™t wait for timorrow ðŸ˜€.
