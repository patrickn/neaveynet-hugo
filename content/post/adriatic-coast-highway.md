Leaving Trieste I was heading for Zadar in Croatia. It was getting very hot as I got further south which reduced the number of miles I could comfortably cover in a day. I overnighted in a hostel in Zadar before taking the Adriatic Coast Highway south to Dubrovnik.

The coast highway reminded me a lot of the fiords of Norway. The mountains are not quite so high but the way the road hugs the coast and twists and winds was very similar. Occasionally small islands dotted the Adriatic and I would pass through small populated areas. Perhaps not as dramatic as Norway, and certainly not as dangerous as some reports of the road suggest, it was fun in places and spectacular in its own way.
