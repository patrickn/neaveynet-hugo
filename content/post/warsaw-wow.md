So, with bike all serviced I left Bia≈Çystok and headed for Warsaw. Before starting this trip I hadn't any idea what to expect in Poland. In fact I hadn't thought much further than Scandinavia. But since arriving in Poland I had been completely blown away. There is some amazing scenery, the people are friendly and it is very cheap.
