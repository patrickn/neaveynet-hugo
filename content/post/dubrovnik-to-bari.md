I arrived in Dubrovnik late afternoon to discover that the next ferry to Bari, Italy was not until 20:30 the next day. So I needed to find a room for the night. In the end, a room found me as there were plenty of locals touting for rooms at the ferry port. After looking a room over I took one right opposite the ferry port.&nbsp;

Dubrovnik was quite interesting, I rode around the old walled city and walked along the harbour. There were all the usual tourist things, bars and restaurants. I had another variation of the scampi I tried last in Norway, this time it was whole and included with the knife and fork were what resembled pliers to help dismantle the shellfish.&nbsp;

The ferry to Bari takes around 10 hours, and as it was overnight at least I didn&#8217;t need to find a room. Cabins are available but I took the cheaper option and stuck with a reclining chair.&nbsp;

After an OK nights sleep I arrived in Bari at about 06:00 the next morning. First impressions of Bari were not good. I wanted to find somewhere to sit, have a coffee and work out what to do next. Everything was closed, so I used my satnav to find the nearest McDonalds. There was a good chance they would be open and have wifi, and if I saw something better along the way I could stop there.&nbsp;

After a couple of dead ends and road closures I eventually reached the McDrive. But I passed through some of the most delapidated areas I&#8217;ve seen, so either I just found the worst of Bari or it&#8217;s not a tourist hotspot. I booked a room in the campus hostel, checked in and went exploring. Eventually after several streets of closed shops and old buildings I did find the city centre. To be fair the centre, and along the harbour are quite picturesque but a big contrast to the rest of Bari.&nbsp;
