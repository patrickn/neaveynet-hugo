I was hoping to make Bodø today but after spending the morning trying to find somewhere to make a more permanent tyre repair it was getting to late. Being Saturday all car repair shops are closed so despite a helpful BMW dealer phoning around I had no choice but to continue.&nbsp;

As long as I take it easy and top up the air every 100 miles or so it&#8217;s not to bad. So I leave the truck stop I spent the night at in Trondheim and continue north.&nbsp;

I took a slight detour just north of Trondheim to go through the village of Hell. There are only a handful of houses in Hell, so I guess it&#8217;s not very popular.&nbsp;

Along the E6 I passed the house of someone who obviously had an American thing going. There were several big US cars including a cop car and a Gas station which I thought was a cafe. It was either closed for the day or permanently though, I couldn&#8217;t tell which.&nbsp;

Ascending up the mountain again it&#8217;s difficult to keep your eyes on the road as the views are so amazing. Everywhere you look is a spectacular lake, river rapid or fiord.&nbsp;

I pass under the Nord-Norge sign, signifying entry to Northern Norway and ride through Mo i Rana, known as the Gateway to the Artic Circle.&nbsp;
