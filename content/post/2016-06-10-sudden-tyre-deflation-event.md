Or puncture if you like. I was getting an amber warning when leaving Lunde about rear tyre pressure. So at the next garage I checked the tyre and couldn&#8217;t see anything obvious. I topped up the air and carried, keeping an eye on the pressure. About 180 miles later whilst waiting for the Aukra ferry I glanced down at the tyre and noticed the head of a nail sticking out. How I missed it earlier I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp;

As I had just booked 2 nights in Aukra I left it until the next day to repair. I pulled out a 4&#8243; nail when I did get round to fixing it. I&#8217;ve plugged it but it&#8217;s still losing air slowly and requires topping up every 100km or so. I&#8217;m going to have to find a more permanent solution as soon as I can.&nbsp;
