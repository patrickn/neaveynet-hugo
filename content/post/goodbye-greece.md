There are hundreds, if not thousands of these shrines along the sides of the road. All different sizes, some new, some old and weathered, some plain, some fancy and some completely dilapidated and abandoned. It's like an allegory for the rest of Greece.

I was on my way to Bulgaria now so just headed east along the E90 to Komotini then north to a border crossing in the mountains. The ride was pretty uneventful, the only relief was the very frequent tolls. They don't charge much, perhaps €1.50 to €2.50, but you can almost see the next toll as you pay your current one. So I programmed my satnav to miss the tolls.
