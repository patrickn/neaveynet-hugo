Left Bristol this morning in sunshine and blue skies. But with typhoon Tim or whatever it&#8217;s called travelling towards me it wasn&#8217;t long before I was experiencing gales and heavy rain. I stopped off on the way to see big sis then continued along the M4. The weather dried up a bit around &nbsp;Reading and remained dry until I got to Harwich about 10:00.&nbsp;

I&#8217;m all aboard now and settled into the cabin. Tomorrow I will be in Holland. ðŸ˜Š
