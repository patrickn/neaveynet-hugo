This has been my office for the week. At the top left you can see the GPS transmiiter that sends my current location the the rally organisers. This allows them to see my location at all times and to know if I am on track or heading the wring way. Top left is my ICO showing kilometres ridden, it is used together with the roadbook (centre). As you can see, I am at kilometre 192.85 (100's are not shown on the ICO) about to bend to the left through a village. At the bottom are the normal dashboard indicators for oil, speedo etc. Plus I have a switch to select front/rear fuel tanks, cooling fan on and to turn ABS off.
